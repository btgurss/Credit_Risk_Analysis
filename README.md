# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I was tasked with finding a machine learning model for a credit card risk data set.  The goal was to see if, by inputting the data into different learning models,  we could come up with an efficient and accurate way of predicting which consumers were most at risk of defaulting on loans.  I ran through numerous models to determine if there were any models that could successfully predict high risk loans and then determined which of these models did the best job.
